# Final Steps to Go Live! 🚀

I have already **initialized the repository and pushed your code** to GitHub for you. You are almost there!

### 1. Enable Automated Deployment
To make your site appear online, follow these 3 clicks on GitHub:
1. Go to your repository: [cheima-madi-portfolio](https://github.com/cheima-madi/cheima-madi-portfolio).
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu).
3. On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, change the dropdown from "Deploy from a branch" to **GitHub Actions**.

### 2. Watch the Magic Happen
1. Click on the **Actions** tab at the top of your repository.
2. You will see a workflow named "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running.
3. Once it finishes (turns green), your site will be live!

### 3. Your Live Link
